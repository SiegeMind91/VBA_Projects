'When we're looking at VBA, it can be helpful to have a list of items, or a value/key pair 
'Now, you might say, "But wait we have arrays!", and that's true, but collections and dictionaries have their own pros and cons. 

'Collections=====================================================================
'Uses a key/value pairing to allow for selection by either
'One pro of a collection over an array is that it does the resizing on the fly, so if we add or remove an item from the list
' we don't have to care for it, nor do we need to worry about empty cells of the colleciton. It is always the correct size. 

'Here we're declaring and creating a collection
Dim colFruit as New Collection

'The collection object doesn't have a 'Clear' or 'RemoveAll' from the list, so instead we can do this to clear the collection
Set colFruit = New Collection

'Here's how we would add an item
'Syntax: col.Add item, key, before, after
colFruit.Add "Apple"
colFruit.Add "Orange"

'Here we're adding the "Lime" object before the Orange
colFruit.Add "Lime", Before:=2

'When we access the items, we have a couple of different methods
Debug.Print colFruit(1) 'This will print Apple
'or
Debug.Print colFruit.Item(1)

'When adding items, we can choose to give them keys that we can refer to later
colScores.Add 99, "Billy"
colScores.Add 75, "Jimmy"
colScores.Add 86, "Sally"

'Which then gives us another method to refer to the item 
Debug.Print colScores("Billy") 'This would print 99

'One of the cons of a collection is that we can't change values once assigned, but we can remove items
colFruit.Remove "Orange"

'Dictionaries=====================================================================
'With the functionality of collections and arrays, it's hard to see the need for dictionaries
'However, dictionaries have 2 major advantages over collections. 1, We can check if a key exists 
' without writing an extra loop. 2, We can change the value once it's written.

'Here we're creating a new dictionary
Dim dictVeggies As New Scripting.Dictionary

'Adding some values, a couple of different ways
dictVeggies.Add key:="Squash", Item:=27
dictVeggies.Add "Tomato", 15

'Here we're checking if a value already exists
If dictVeggies.Exists("Cucumber") Then 
  msgbox("It already exists!") 
Else 
  dictVeggies.Add key:="Cucumber", Item:=5 
End If

'Here we can change the value
dictVeggies("Squash") = 32
